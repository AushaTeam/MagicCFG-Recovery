# MagicCFG Recovery
 The code behind the small brother of MagicCFG :)

MagicCFG Recovery is the little brother of MagicCFG and specializes in recovering lost configuration data.
The tool requires a jailbreak to extract the configuration data.
Since I'm quiet busy, maybe someone have the time and motivation to improve the tool.
Feel free to contribute and fork :)

How to build
1) Clone this project
2) Install cocoapods
3) Open Xcode and build/run

Enjoy :)
